# Movie Recommendation Project
A website that recommends movies for users

## Description

With so many streaming services out there, it can be hard to know what to watch next. 

This project has been designed to help users discover their next movie without the endless scrolling through Netflix, Binge, Disney+ and all the other streaming services. 

Users can log on to this website and discover the top rated movies from around the world. If they are in the mood for a particular genre, they can filter by genre as well to narrow down their choice.
